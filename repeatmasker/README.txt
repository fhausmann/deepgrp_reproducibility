Unfortunatly, due to license issues, not all files neccessary
to reproduce the RepeatMasker outputs can be provided here.

To run it yourself, you need a file called `humrep.ref´ in EMBL format.
This can be obtained from Repbase (https://www.girinst.org/repbase/).
Additonally, a working copy of RepeatMasker and an alignment tool are necessary.
The alignment tool used in the DeepGRP paper was
cross_match (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html).

If you have repeatmasker installed in a custom path (instead of `RepeatMasker´),
update `run_linux.sh´ accordingly please.
