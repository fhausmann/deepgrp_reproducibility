Unfortunatly due to license issues, not all files neccessary
to reproduce the RepeatMasker outputs can be provided here.

To run it yourself you need a file called `humrep.ref´ in EMBL format.
This can be optained form Repbase (https://www.girinst.org/repbase/).
Additonally a working copy of RepeatMasker and an alignment tool.
Alignment zool used in the DeepGRP paper was
cross_match (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html).

If you have repeatmasker in a custom path (instead of `RepeatMasker´)
installed please, update `run_linux.sh´ accordingly.
